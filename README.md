Hey, my names crllect, I started working on this proxy pretty recently, I think its comming along pretty nicely, if you encounter any issues, contact me on [discord](https://discord.com/users/713488984596021291).

## Current features:
 - Pretty clean UI
 - Ability to view and clear search history
 - Uploading / adding custom CSS
 - Ability to toggle search engine
 - Both UltraViolet and Dynamic proxies are setup and toggleable.
---
## TODO:
 - Muiltiple tabs (this is going to be a seperate project/repo)
 - Add rammerhead as a proxy option
 - Add DIP as a proxy option
 - Change how to open the window, E.G. Embed vs New Tab
 - Tab Cloaking (Favicon and Title, along with some presets)
 - Add css for proxyConfig
 - Add my game lib, and also add 3kh0 game lib. Might also have a ruffle embed built in. Depends if this gains any traction or not
 - On first open, make the user go to settings to add a theme, and add a breif tutorial on changing proxies and when to do so (Very Low priority)

If you even moderately enjoy this, star this and follow my GitHub, I promise you wont regret it.
Add some PRs if you notice any easy bugs or stupid design decisions.

If someone could make some simple css themes using the built in template that would be nice. I could do it myself, but im a little busy at the moment, and making some themes is time consuming if you want to make them look any good.
